PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given an array of length ‘N’, where each element denotes the position of a stall. Now you have ‘N’ stalls and an integer ‘K’ which denotes the number of cows
that are aggressive. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, you need to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of 
them is as large as possible. Return the largest minimum distance.

Sample Input 1 :
2
3 2
1 2 3
5 2
4 2 1 3 6
Sample Output 1 :
2
5
Explanation To Sample Input 1 :
In the first test case, the largest minimum distance will be 2 when 2 cows are placed at positions {1, 3}.

In the second test case, the largest minimum distance will be 5 when 2 cows are placed at positions {1, 6}.
